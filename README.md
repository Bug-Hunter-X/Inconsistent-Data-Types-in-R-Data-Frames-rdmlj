This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in R related to data frame creation.  When creating a data frame with a column that mixes numeric and character values, R might not raise an immediate error but will silently coerce the numeric values into characters. This can lead to unexpected downstream errors if not handled correctly. The solution demonstrates how to avoid this issue by ensuring type consistency or using more robust functions for data frame creation.
